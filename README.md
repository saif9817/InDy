# InDy
A python program to help you deal with indecision!

InDy takes as many input choices as you want 
and generates several random numbers to decide 
which choice you should make, it also shows each
option as a percentage of how many of the random 
numbers produced that choice, this gives you not only
the top random option but every subsequent choice too
should you wish to make more than one choice or even sort
the choices randomly
